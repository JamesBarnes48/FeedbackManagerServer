# FeedbackManagerServer

This is a web application to enable you to fill out a feedback form and then have it rendered on the screen. This is backend handles api calls and interacting with a MongoDB database mainly. Serving files is handled by Vite.

This is meant to be a chance to put Typescript concepts and processes into action and practice on a real project.

# Running the Project

'npm run dev' is mapped to 'ts-node server.js' so this server can be spun up using that command
